Feature: Delete line item from Shopping List
  In order to have ability to manage shopping list
  As a Buyer
  I want to delete line item from Shopping List and this should not affect
  another line items with the same product but different unit

  Scenario: Delete product from Shopping List
    Given I login as AmandaRCole@example.org buyer
    And Buyer is on "Shopping List 5" shopping list
    And I click "Shopping List Actions"
    And I click "Edit"
    And I should see following grid:
      | SKU | Qty Update All |
      | AA1 | 1 item ( set ) |
      | AA1 | 2 ( item ) set |
    And I click on "Shopping List Line Item 1 Quantity"
    And I type "5" in "Shopping List Line Item 1 Quantity Input"
    When I click Delete AA1 in grid
    And I click "Yes, Delete" in modal window
    Then I should see 'The "Product1" product was successfully deleted' flash message
    Then I should not see "You have unsaved changes, are you sure you want to leave this page?"
    And I should see following grid:
      | SKU | Qty Update All |
      | AA1 | 2 ( item ) set |

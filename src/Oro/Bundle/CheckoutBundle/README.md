# OroCheckoutBundle

OroCheckoutBundle enables checkout workflows in the OroCommerce storefront to collect all the necessary information from the customer when they are creating an order. For back-office administrators, this bundle provides the ability to switch between the single page and multi-step page checkout workflows using the system workflow management UI.

Please see [online documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/backend/bundles/commerce/CheckoutBundle/) for more information.

Feature: Address Validation - Multi-Step - Billing - Dialog Not Displayed When Feature Disabled
  As an Buyer
  I should not see address validation when feature disabled

  Scenario: Feature Background
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to System/ Configuration
    And follow "Commerce/Shipping/Address Validation" on configuration sidebar
    When I fill "Address Validation Configuration Form" with:
      | Address Validation Service Use Default | false |
      | Address Validation Service             | false |
    And I submit form
    Then I should see "Configuration saved" flash message

  Scenario: Address Validation modal not displayed
    Given I signed in as AmandaRCole@example.org on the store frontend
    When I open page with shopping list List 1
    And I click "Create Order"
    And I click "Continue"
    Then I should see "Shipping Address"

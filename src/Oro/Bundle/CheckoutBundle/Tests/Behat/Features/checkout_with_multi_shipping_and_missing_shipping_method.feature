Feature: Checkout With Multi Shipping And Missing Shipping Method
  In order to control shipping methods for each order line item
  As a Customer User
  I want to see shipping method selection for each line item in checkout

  Scenario: Create sessions
    Given sessions active:
      | Admin | first_session  |
      | Buyer | second_session |
    And I change configuration options:
      | oro_checkout.enable_shipping_method_selection_per_line_item | true |

  Scenario: Set stricter rule for the shipping method
    Given I proceed as the Admin
    And I login as administrator

    And fill "Shipping Rule" with:
      | Expression | subtotal.value >= 12 |

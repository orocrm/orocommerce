Feature: Checkout multiple units product with distinct shipping rules
  In order to checkout a product with multiple units to have correct shipping price
  As a Buyer
  I need to have two distinct shipping rules and watch a rule be applied correctly

  Scenario: I Login in frontend store and prepare for following test
    Given I signed in as AmandaRCole@example.org on the store frontend

  Scenario Outline: Checkout every shipping list to check every shipping price are correctly calculated
    When I open page with shopping list <shoppingList>
    And I click "Create Order"
    And I select "Fifth avenue, 10115 Berlin, Germany" on the "Billing Information" checkout step and press Continue
    And I select "Fifth avenue, 10115 Berlin, Germany" on the "Shipping Information" checkout step and press Continue
    And I should see "Flat Rate <shippingPrice>"
    And I click "Expand Checkout Footer"
    Then I should see Checkout Totals with data:
      | Subtotal | <subtotal>      |
      | Shipping | <shippingPrice> |
    Examples:
      | shoppingList | subtotal | shippingPrice |
      | List 1       | $130.00  | $100.00       |
      | List 2       | $130.00  | $100.00       |
      | List 3       | $20.00   | $10.00        |
      | List 4       | $240.00  | $100.00       |

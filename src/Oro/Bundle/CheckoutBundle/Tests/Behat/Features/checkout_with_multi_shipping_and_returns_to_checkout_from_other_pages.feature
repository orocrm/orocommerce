Feature: Checkout With Multi Shipping And Returns To Checkout From Other Pages
  In order to create separate sub orders
  As a Customer User
  I want to see that selected line items shipping methods are saved when I follow to other pages and return back to checkout

  Scenario: Create sessions
    Given sessions active:
      | Admin | first_session  |
      | Buyer | second_session |
    And I change configuration options:
      | oro_checkout.enable_shipping_method_selection_per_line_item | true             |
      | oro_checkout.enable_line_item_grouping                      | true             |
      | oro_checkout.group_line_items_by                            | product.category |
      | oro_checkout.create_suborders_for_each_group                | true             |

Feature: RFQ with fractional price
  In order to use correct decimal separator for fractional prices in different locales
  As an Buyer and Administrator
    I should see fractional prices formatted according locale settings in the process of RFQ.
    Also I should offer new fractional price using decimal delimiter according locale settings.

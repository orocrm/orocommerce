        <h6>H6. I find myself...</h6>
        
        <p>“I find myself happier and more enthused about life when I’m outside and in what people would consider wilderness. That feels like home to me, so creating my own space that facilitates that is worth it, and that’s going to be different for everyone.”</p>

        <p>Photographs are a way of preserving a moment in our lives for the rest of our lives. Many of us have at least been tempted at the flashy array of photo printers which seemingly leap off the shelves at even the least tech-savvy. It surely seems old fashioned to talk about 35mm film and non-digital cameras in today’s day and age.</p>

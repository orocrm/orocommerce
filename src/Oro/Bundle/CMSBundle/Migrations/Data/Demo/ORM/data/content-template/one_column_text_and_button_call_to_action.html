        <h1>Choosing The Best Audio Player Software For Your Computer</h1>
        <p>Consider drawing a map of your room and sketch the possible placements of your furniture, components and speakers. Measure the roomâ€™s dimensions and write them down. Make a list of all the inputs you currently have and will continue to use. Make a list of the inputs you intend to add to your new audio system. You should write down which components are going to need cables and wires. Also, write down the approximate lengths of those cables and wires. Once all of this is worked out carry this information and map with you when you go out to buy your new audio system</p>

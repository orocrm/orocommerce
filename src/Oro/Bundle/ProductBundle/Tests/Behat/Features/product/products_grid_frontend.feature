  In order to ensure frontend products grid works correctly
  As a buyer
  I check filters are working and sorting is working as designed.

  Scenario: Visit page with incorrect number
    Given I signed in as AmandaRCole@example.org on the store frontend
    When open page number test of frontend product grid
    Then should not see "There was an error performing the requested operation. Please try again or contact us for assistance." flash message
    And I should see "PSKU1"
    And number of records in "Product Frontend Grid" should be 19

  Scenario: Check Fulltext Filter
    Given number of records in "Product Frontend Grid" should be 19

    And I should not see "PSKU1"
    And I click "Clear All Filters"

  Scenario: Check Price Filter
    Given number of records in "Product Frontend Grid" should be 19

  In order to have custom attributes for Product entity
  As an Administrator

    And I fill form with:
      | Field Name | DateField |
      | Type       | Date      |
    And I click "Continue"

    And I should see that "Product Attribute Storefront Options" does not contain "Filterable"
    And I should see that "Product Attribute Storefront Options" contains "Sortable"

    When I fill form with:
      | Sortable | Yes |
    And I save and close form
    Then I should see "Attribute was successfully saved" flash message
    And I should not see "Update schema"

    When I check "Date" in "Data Type" filter

  Scenario: Check product grid sorter
    Given I login as AmandaRCole@example.org buyer

Feature: Improve manage grid swipe actions
  As an User
  I want to be sure that there is ability to move elements on mobile devices
  So I login as User on different screen resolution and check this functionality

  Scenario: Checked drag and drop option in "Manage grid" popup on mobile view
    Given I login as AmandaRCole@example.org the "Buyer" at "640_session" session
    And I set window size to 640x1100
    And I click "Account Dropdown"
    And click "Users"
    Then I should see following grid with exact columns order:
      | First Name | Last Name | Email Address           | Enabled | Confirmed |
      | Amanda     | Cole      | AmandaRCole@example.org | Yes     | Yes       |
    When click on "Responsive Dropdown Action"
    And click "Manage Table"
    Then I should see an "Manage Grid Fullscreen Popup" element
    And click "Deselect All Button"
    And click "Close Fullscreen Popup"
    # Last enabled column remains selected when deselecting all columns in grid
    Then I should see following grid with exact columns order:
      | Locked |
      | No     |
    When click on "Responsive Dropdown Action"
    And click "Manage Table"
    Then I should see an "Manage Grid Fullscreen Popup" element
    And click "Reset Grid"
    And click "Close Fullscreen Popup"
    Then I should see following grid with exact columns order:
      | First Name | Last Name | Email Address           | Enabled | Confirmed | Password | Locked |
      | Amanda     | Cole      | AmandaRCole@example.org | Yes     | Yes       | Active   | No     |
    When click on "Responsive Dropdown Action"
    And click "Manage Table"
    Then I should see an "Manage Grid Fullscreen Popup" element
    When I drag and drop "Email Address Handle" before "First Name Handle"
    # Unchecking custom checkbox
    And click "Last Name In Grid Management"
    And click "Close Fullscreen Popup"
    Then I should see following grid with exact columns order:
      | Email Address           | First Name | Enabled | Confirmed | Password | Locked |
      | AmandaRCole@example.org | Amanda     | Yes     | Yes       | Active   | No     |
    When click on "Responsive Dropdown Action"
    And click "Manage Table"
    Then I should see an "Manage Grid Fullscreen Popup" element
    And click "Select All Button"
    And click "Close Fullscreen Popup"

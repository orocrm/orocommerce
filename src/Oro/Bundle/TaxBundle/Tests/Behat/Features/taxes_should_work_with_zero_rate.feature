Feature: Taxes should work with zero rate
  In order to be able to make purchases
  As a buyer
  I want to be able to create orders with products that have taxes with zero rate

  Scenario: Feature Background
    Given sessions active:
      | Admin | first_session  |
      | Buyer | second_session |
    And I proceed as the Admin
    And I login as administrator
    And I go to System/Configuration
    And I follow "Commerce/Taxation/Tax Calculation" on configuration sidebar
    And uncheck "Use default" for "Use as Base by Default" field
    And uncheck "Use default" for "Origin Address" field
    And I fill "Tax Calculation Form" with:
      | Use As Base By Default | Origin  |
      | Origin Country         | Germany |
      | Origin Region          | Berlin  |
      | Origin Zip Code        | 10115   |
    And I save form

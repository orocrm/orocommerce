  As a back office user
  I want to see right formatted dates while using chinese localization

  Scenario: Change user`s localization to chinese
    Given I login as administrator
    When I go to System / Configuration

    And fill form with:
      | Enabled Localizations | [Chinese (China), English (United States)] |
      | Default Localization  | Chinese (China)                            |

    When I click My Configuration in user menu
    And I follow "System Configuration/General Setup/Localization" on configuration sidebar
    And uncheck "Use Organization" for "Default Localization" field
    And I fill form with:
